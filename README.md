# Dynamic-Pricing-Classifier


Dynamic Pricing Classifier

Description:
This Python application utilizes a logistic regression model to predict binary outcomes based on input data. Specifically, it demonstrates the classification of ground truth values using the logistic regression algorithm. The main functionalities include data preprocessing, model training, prediction, evaluation, and performance logging.

Features:

Data Preprocessing: The application takes input data in the form of a dictionary and separates the features (X) and target variable (y).
Model Training: It uses logistic regression to train a classification model on the provided dataset.
Prediction: The trained model is used to predict outcomes on a test dataset.
Evaluation: The accuracy of the model is evaluated using sklearn's accuracy_score metric.
Logging: The application logs the execution time and key events using Python's logging module.
Dependencies:

pandas
sklearn
time
logging
Usage:

Ensure the required dependencies are installed (pip install pandas scikit-learn).
Run the script, and it will output the improved accuracy of the logistic regression model along with the execution time.
Example Output:
